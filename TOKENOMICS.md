# NILKhype Tokenomics V2.0 - Enhanced DeFi Integration

## Overview

NILKhype features a sophisticated dual-token economy with enhanced DeFi mechanics, HYPE integration, and sustainable reward systems designed for a 2-month engagement cycle.

## Token Ecosystem

### Core Tokens
- **Raw Nilk**: Production asset (inflationary, game-generated)
- **$NILK**: Utility token (deflationary through fees + burns)
- **HYPE**: Bridge asset (Hyperliquid ecosystem integration)

### Enhanced Value Flow
```
Cows → Raw Nilk → Processing (fees) → $NILK → Multiple Sinks
                     ↓
                Treasury → Buyback/Burn + LP Rewards
                     ↓
                HYPE Pool → Cross-ecosystem liquidity
```

## Enhanced Production Rates (5x Boost)

### Cow Production (Raw Nilk/Day)
- **Common Cow**: 5,000 Raw Nilk/day (was 1,000)
- **Cosmic Cow**: 15,000 Raw Nilk/day (was 3,000)
- **Galactic Cow**: 25,000 Raw Nilk/day (was 5,000)

### Processing Efficiency
- **Manual Processing**: 35% efficiency (was 35%)

  - Bountiful Yield: 1,750 Raw Nilk + 300 $NILK (was 100)
  - Efficient Processing: 1,000 Raw Nilk + 150 $NILK (was 50)

### Yield Booster System (Increased 3x)
- **Level 1**: 36,000 $NILK (was 12,000) (1.21x multiplier)
- **Level 2**: 50,400 $NILK (was 16,800) (1.331x multiplier)
- **Level 3**: 70,560 $NILK (was 23,520) (1.4641x multiplier)

## Enhanced Liquidity Mining

### Dynamic Reward System
- **Base APR**: 25% (significantly increased from 0.1%)
- **Small Pool Bonus**: Up to 50% APR for pools < 100k LP tokens
- **Early Adopter Bonus**: 1.5x multiplier for first 30 days
- **Pool Size Formula**: `Math.min(50%, 25% * Math.max(1, 100000 / totalLpTokens))`

### Trading Fees
- **Fee Rate**: 0.3% on all swaps
- **Fee Distribution**:
  - 50% to LP holders (sustainable rewards)
  - 50% to treasury (protocol sustainability)

### LP Reward Calculation
```typescript
const poolSizeMultiplier = Math.max(1, 100000 / totalLpTokens);
const baseAPR = Math.min(0.5, 0.25 * poolSizeMultiplier);
const earlyAdopterBonus = poolAge < 30 ? 1.5 : 1.0;
const rewards = userPoolShare * nilkReserve * baseAPR * timeElapsed * earlyAdopterBonus;
```

## HYPE Token Integration

### HYPE Acquisition Methods

#### 1. Marketplace Purchases
- All items purchasable with HYPE at 500:1 NILK ratio
- Dual currency options for premium items
- HYPE-exclusive items and bonuses

#### 2. Achievement-Based Rewards

- **Fusion Milestones**: 0.12-0.36 HYPE ($5-15) for cow fusion achievements
- **Liquidity Milestones**: 0.24-0.6 HYPE ($10-25) for LP participation goals

#### 3. Treasury-Managed Distribution
- Treasury HYPE pool (240 HYPE starting balance = $10,000)
- Dynamic reward rates based on treasury health
- Emergency reserve for market stability

### HYPE Marketplace Items
