# GOT NILK? - Tokenomics & DeFi Mechanics

## 1. Project Overview

**GOT NILK?** is an immersive, gamified DeFi experience built on the Hyperliquid EVM. Players embark on a cosmic journey to build and manage a thriving space-cow farm, harvest valuable **Raw Nilk**, and process it into the utility token **$NILK**. The core gameplay loop revolves around strategic resource management, asset upgrades, and economic decision-making to maximize $NILK production and farm efficiency.

The game is designed with a sustainable and engaging economy, focusing on in-game utility, strategic depth, and long-term player progression, appealing to discerning investors looking for high-value digital commodities.

## 2. Token System

The GOT NILK? economy is powered by a dual-asset system:

### 2.1. $NILK Token (Primary Utility Token)

*   **Ticker**: `$NILK`
*   **Type**: ERC20 standard token on the Hyperliquid EVM.
*   **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion) $NILK. This is the fixed maximum supply.
*   **Launch Mechanism**: $NILK will be introduced to the ecosystem via a Fair Launch event on a Hyperliquid-based platform.
*   **Initial Distribution**:
    *   **Community (via Fair Launch)**: 80-85% of the total supply will be available to the community through the fair launch.
    *   **Project Allocation (from Fair Launch)**: The project aims to secure 15-20% of the total supply (150M - 200M $NILK) through participation in the fair launch. This allocation will be used for:
        *   **Treasury Seeding**: A portion will be allocated to the game's Treasury to kickstart its functions (see Section 4).
        *   **Team & Development Fund**: For ongoing game development, maintenance, and future feature expansion.
        *   **Marketing & Ecosystem Growth**: To attract new players and foster community engagement.
        *   **Long-Term Incentives**: Reserved for future strategic initiatives, partnerships, or community rewards.
*   **Core Utilities**: $NILK is the lifeblood of the in-game economy and is used for:
    *   Purchasing new **Cows** of various tiers.
    *   Purchasing **Nilk Processing Machines** (Standard and Pro tiers).
    *   Paying for **Cow Evolution** (leveling up individual cows).
    *   Paying for **Yield Booster** upgrades (increasing farm-wide Raw Nilk production).
    *   Paying **Fusion Fees** for creating higher-tier Cows and Pro Machines.

### 2.2. Raw Nilk (In-Game Resource)

*   **Nature**: Raw Nilk is a non-tradable, in-game resource generated by Cows.
*   **Generation**: Cows produce Raw Nilk over time, with production rates dependent on the Cow's tier and level.
*   **Utility**: The sole utility of Raw Nilk is to be processed in the Nilk Factory into the $NILK token.
*   **Harvesting**: Players must actively harvest Raw Nilk from their cows, subject to cooldown periods.

## 3. Core Economic Assets & Mechanics

### 3.1. Cows (NFTs / In-Game Assets)

Cows are the primary productive assets in GOT NILK?. They come in different tiers, influencing their Raw Nilk output and fusion capabilities. Progression through cow tiers is achieved via direct purchase (at a premium) or through a more cost-effective fusion system.

*   **Tier 1: Common Cow**
    *   **Base Raw Nilk/Day**: 1,000
    *   **Acquisition**:
        *   Direct Purchase Cost: 13,000 $NILK.
    *   **Fusion Input**: Two Tier 1 Common Cows are required to fuse into one Tier 2 Cosmic Cow.

*   **Tier 2: Cosmic Cow**
    *   **Base Raw Nilk/Day**: 3,500
    *   **Acquisition**:
        *   **Fusion Path**: (2 x Tier 1 Common Cows) + 15,000 $NILK Fusion Fee.
            *   *Effective Fusion Cost (if Tier 1s are bought at 13k each)*: (2 * 13,000 $NILK) + 15,000 $NILK = 41,000 $NILK.
        *   **Direct Purchase Cost**: 55,000 $NILK (incentivizes fusion).
    *   **Fusion Input**: Four Tier 2 Cosmic Cows are required to fuse into one Tier 3 Galactic Moo Moo.

*   **Tier 3: Galactic Moo Moo**
    *   **Base Raw Nilk/Day**: 15,000
    *   **Acquisition**:
        *   **Fusion Path**: (4 x Tier 2 Cosmic Cows) + 70,000 $NILK Fusion Fee.
            *   *Effective Fusion Cost (if T2s are fused at 41k each)*: (4 * 41,000 $NILK) + 70,000 $NILK = 234,000 $NILK.
        *   **Direct Purchase Cost**: 300,000 $NILK (incentivizes fusion).

*   **Cow Evolution (Leveling)**:
    *   Individual cows (within any tier) can be leveled up to a maximum of Level 10.
    *   Each level increases the cow's current `rawNilkPerDay` by 15% (multiplicatively, compounding per level).
    *   The $NILK cost for evolution depends on the Cow's Tier and its current level. Costs are:
        *   Tier 1 Cow Evolution: Base Cost `1,200 $NILK` + `600 $NILK` for each current level the cow possesses.
        *   Tier 2 Cow Evolution: Base Cost `4,000 $NILK` + `2,000 $NILK` for each current level the cow possesses.
        *   Tier 3 Cow Evolution: Base Cost `18,000 $NILK` + `9,000 $NILK` for each current level the cow possesses.

*   **Harvesting**: Cows produce Raw Nilk continuously, but it must be harvested by the player. Each cow has an individual harvest cooldown (e.g., 6-24 hours).

### 3.2. Nilk Processing Machines

Machines are essential for converting Raw Nilk into usable $NILK tokens. Higher-tier machines offer better conversion rates and lower processing fees.

*   **Manual Processing** (Default, no cost)
    *   Conversion Rate (Raw Nilk to $NILK): 0.25 (25%)
    *   Processing Fee: 12% (of gross $NILK processed)

*   **Standard Nilk Machine**
    *   Conversion Rate: 0.35 (35%)
    *   Processing Fee: 8%
    *   **Acquisition**:
        *   Direct Purchase Cost: 10,000 $NILK.
    *   **Fusion Input**: Two Standard Nilk Machines are required to fuse into one Pro Nilk Machine.

*   **Pro Nilk Machine**
    *   Conversion Rate: 0.45 (45%)
    *   Processing Fee: 4%
    *   **Acquisition**:
        *   **Fusion Path**: (2 x Standard Nilk Machines) + 5,000 $NILK Fusion Fee.
            *   *Effective Fusion Cost (if Standard bought at 10k)*: (2 * 10,000 $NILK) + 5,000 $NILK = 25,000 $NILK.
        *   **Direct Purchase Cost**: 35,000 $NILK (incentivizes fusion).

### 3.3. Farm Upgrades

These are global upgrades that affect the entire farm's productivity.

*   **Yield Booster**:
    *   **Function**: Increases the `rawNilkPerDay` for ALL owned cows by 10% per upgrade level (multiplicative).
    *   **Cost**: Level 1 costs 12,000 $NILK. Each subsequent level costs 1.4 times the $NILK cost of the previous level.

## 4. Treasury & Economic Cycle

The Treasury is a critical component of the GOT NILK? economy, designed to ensure sustainability and reward players.

### 4.1. Treasury Funding Sources

The Treasury accumulates $NILK from various in-game activities:

*   **Processing Fees**: A percentage of all $NILK processed in the Nilk Factory is sent to the Treasury.
*   **Initial Supply Allocation**: A portion of the project's $NILK allocation from the fair launch will be used to seed the Treasury.
*   **$NILK Sinks**: All $NILK spent by players on:
    *   Purchasing Cows (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).
    *   Purchasing Nilk Processing Machines (Standard, Pro).
    *   Cow Evolution upgrades.
    *   Yield Booster upgrades.
    *   Fusion fees for Cows and Machines.
    ...is directed to the Treasury.

### 4.2. Treasury Utility: Buyback & Burn/Redistribute

The primary function of the Treasury is to actively manage the $NILK supply and redistribute value:

*   **Buyback Mechanism**: The Treasury will periodically use its accumulated $NILK (or other assets it may hold if diversified in the future) to buy back $NILK tokens from the open market (e.g., from a liquidity pool on a Hyperliquid DEX).
*   **Post-Buyback Allocation**: Once $NILK is bought back, it will be allocated to:
    *   **Burning (Deflation)**: A significant portion of the bought-back $NILK will be permanently burned (sent to an unrecoverable address), reducing the circulating supply and creating deflationary pressure.
    *   **Redistribution (Player Rewards)**: The remaining portion of bought-back $NILK will be used to fund player-centric initiatives, such as:
        *   Staking rewards for $NILK holders.
        *   Rewards for in-game achievements or special events.
        *   Contributions to prize pools for community tournaments or leaderboards.
        *   Funding further liquidity provisioning efforts.
*   *(The exact percentage split between burning and redistribution may be adjusted based on game economy health and community governance if implemented in the future.)*

This cycle ensures that value generated within the game flows back to support the token's health and reward active participation.

## 5. Economic Design Goals & Sustainability

The tokenomics of GOT NILK? are designed with the following principles in mind:

*   **Utility-Driven Demand**: $NILK's primary value comes from its extensive in-game uses for progression and enhancement.
*   **Robust $NILK Sinks**: Multiple, meaningful ways for $NILK to be removed from circulation or returned to the Treasury, balancing its generation.
*   **Exponential Progression Costs**: The cost and effort to reach the highest tiers of Cows and Machines increase significantly, providing long-term goals and managing the pace of late-game players. This is achieved through both scaling $NILK costs and increasing numbers of base assets required for fusion.
*   **Active Supply Management**: The Treasury's Buyback & Burn/Redistribute mechanism provides an active tool to manage circulating supply and counteract inflation.
*   **Focus on In-Game Value Loop**: The economy is designed to reward players for engaging with the core game mechanics rather than relying purely on speculative external market dynamics or new player inflow to sustain earlier participants.
*   **Preventing "Ponzi Dumpenomics"**: By ensuring value is derived from in-game activities, providing strong token sinks, and managing supply, the design aims to create a sustainable economic model rather than one reliant on unsustainable payout structures.
*   **Appealing to High-Value Investors**: The significantly increased asset and upgrade costs position $NILK and in-game assets as premium digital commodities, attracting investors seeking substantial stakes in a luxury-tier DeFi game.

This document outlines the core tokenomic framework for GOT NILK?. Details may be further refined, and new mechanics may be introduced as the game evolves, always with the goal of a balanced and engaging player-driven economy.
